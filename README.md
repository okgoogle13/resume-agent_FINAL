# ü§ñ Resume Agent

Resume Agent is a powerful, AI-driven Streamlit application designed to help you create professional and tailored job application documents, including resumes, cover letters, and Key Selection Criteria (KSC) responses.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Leverages Google's Gemini API to craft compelling content for your application documents.
- **Dynamic Document Creation:** Generate tailored documents on-the-fly based on your personal profile, career history, and specific job descriptions.
- **Company Intelligence:** Uses the Perplexity API to gather real-time insights about a company's values, mission, and recent news to further customize your application.
- **Semantic Caching:** To improve speed and reduce costs, the agent uses an intelligent caching layer. Instead of re-running API calls for queries that are slightly different but conceptually the same, it uses vector embeddings to find and return semantically similar cached results.
- **Multiple Document Types:** Supports the creation of:
    - Resumes
    - Cover Letters
    - Key Selection Criteria (KSC) responses
- **Local Data Storage:** Securely stores your user profile and career history in a local SQLite database.
- **Flexible Export Options:** Download your generated documents as either DOCX or PDF files.
